// Strings    (26/01/2025)

const name = "abhijeet"
const repoCount = 50

// console.log(name + repoCount + " Value");  // not recommended at all

// So we use backticks(``)

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my repoCount is ${repoCount}`);  // modern way. this is known as string interpolation
